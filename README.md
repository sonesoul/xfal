# xfal
XNA Framework Abstraction Library (xfal) adds object oriented implementation of basic rendering system, input handling, time management, and even coroutines to simplify 
creation of graphical applications and games when using XNA-compatible frameworks since it is based on Microsoft.Xna.Framework namespace.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/sonesoul/xfal/releases  
2. Add xfal.dll to your XNA or MonoGame project as a Project Reference (make sure your project is in .NET 6.0 or higher)
3. Add usings
```csharp
using xfal;                 // StepTask, Time, Asset ...
using xfal.Drawing;         // Drawer, Camera, DrawContext ...
using xfal.InputHandling;   // Input, Key
using xfal.Extensions;      // Vector2Extensions, NumericExtensions ...
```
4. You're done!

> [!TIP]
> Copy the file to your project so it will be self-contained 

## How To Use?
Depending on your needs you can use specified modules of xfal. Basic modules are: 

[Rendering](#rendering)  
[StepTask (coroutine)](#steptask)  
[Time](#time)  
[Input](#input)  

Mostly they are all separate. If you don't need a module - just ignore it unless otherwise expected.

# Rendering
To draw something, create a proper function.
```csharp
void Draw(DrawContext draw)
{
  // draw a rectangle on 0,0 position with width and height 10
  draw.Rectangle(new Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 10), Color.White);
} 
```
> [!NOTE]
> `DrawContext` has different kinds of methods for drawing. You can still use `SpriteBatch.Draw(...)`, but **DO NOT** use `SpriteBatch.Begin(...)` or `SpriteBatch.End(...)`.

For `draw.Texture(...)` and some others there is the `DrawOptions` structure in arguments. It is used to combine several parameters in one object, so consider it as just a simpler way to give arguments: 

```csharp
DrawOptions opts = new DrawOptions() { 
  position = new Vector2(x, y),
  origin = new Vector2(x, y),
  scale = new Vector2(width, height),
  color = Color.White,
  rotationRad = Deg2Rad(45) 
};

//you can store it as long as you need and change at any time
opts.position = Vector2.Zero;

drawer.DrawTexture(texture, opts);
```

Then, you'll have to register the method:
```csharp
//registering for rendering
drawer.OutputCamera.Register(Draw);
```
You can also use more than one camera:
```csharp
drawer.AddCamera(new Camera(renderSource, new Point(1920, 1080, order: 1)));
drawer.GetCamera(1).Register(Draw);
```
> [!NOTE]
> Each camera handles only its own registered draws.

When needed, call `drawer.Draw()` or you can split the rendering if you have specific needs.
```csharp
drawer.RenderAll();   // renders everything on the single frame
drawer.Clear();       // clears the screen
drawer.DrawCanvas();  // draws the frame to the screen 
```

# StepTask 
StepTask is a kind of coroutine. It helps with organizing independent running methods: interpolations, delays, etc. 
```csharp
IEnumerator MyCoroutine() 
{ 
    yield return StepTask.Yields.WaitForSeconds(3);
}

StepTask task = StepTask.Run(MyCoroutine(3)); 
```
`StepTask.Yields` has some methods to manage your waiting time in the coroutine.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> `StepTask.Yields.WaitForSeconds(...)` and `StepTask.WaitForRealSeconds(...)` depend on `xfal.Time.Delta` and `xfal.Time.RealDelta`, so if you're using them, `xfal.Time` should be updated before

It is easily extendable by making an extension class and overriding YieldInstruction.
```csharp
//classical extensions class
static class YieldInstructionExtensions 
{ 
    IEnumerator MyExtension(this YieldInstruction _) { yield return null; }
}

//then you can call it
yield return StepTask.Yields.MyExtension();
```
To make all your coroutines work, call `StepTask.Update()` in a main loop. Each update makes only **one call** in all coroutines straight to the next `yield return`.

# Time
For managing time, there is `xfal.Time` or just `Time` class. It's static. Call `Time.Update(...)` before any time-dependant updates. 
```csharp
var delta = Time.Delta;       // depends on Time.TimeScale
var rdelta = Time.RealDelta;  // doesn't depend on Time.TimeScale
var fdelta = Time.FixedDelta; // always the same. Equals 1/60 by default

Time.TimeScale = 0.5f;       // time (Time.Delta) is 2 times slower
Time.FixedDelta = 1.0f / 30; // making bigger steps, can cause less accuracy in some physics engines 
```

# Input
xfal has `Input` class which combines mouse handling and keyboard handling. It uses `xfal.Key` enum, which also includes both keyboard and mouse buttons. Needs to be updated through `Input.Update()` to work properly.
```csharp
if (Input.IsKeyDown(Key.MouseLeft))
  DoSomething(); 

//or you can use events
void HandleKey(Key k)
{
  if (k == MouseLeft)
    DoSomething();
}

Input.KeyPressed += HandleKey;
Input.KeyReleased += HandleKey;
``` 
> [!NOTE]
> There is `Input.MousePosition` property. It returns position on the screen. Since cameras have different resolution, you'll have to use `drawer.ScreenToWorldPoint(screenPos, camera)` to get position based on the viewport of the camera.

# Tips
Rendering module makes resolution of the application static. If you want to use this ✨ _fancy_ ✨ rendering system but don't want to deal with static resolution, there is an easy fix: 
```csharp
Window.ClientSizeChanged += (obj, args) =>
{
    drawer.Canvas.Size = Window.ClientBounds.Size;
    drawer.OutputCamera.Size = Window.ClientBounds.Size;
};
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you have lots of cameras, you'll have to update them all.
---

Each `Camera` has its own properties for drawing. You can make its background transparent which can be really useful when you have a camera used only for UI rendering.
```csharp
drawer.GetCamera(UI_CAMERA_ORDER).BackgroundColor = Color.Transparent; 
```
---

When `Graphics.Viewport` changes, `Drawer` automatically adjusts output (in `DrawCanvas(...)` method) using specific scaling function - and you can make and use your own one!
This could be done the same way as mentioned in `YieldInstruction overriding`. 
```csharp
static class RectScalerExtensions
{
  public Rectangle MyScale(this RectScaler _, in Point source, in Rectangle target)
  {
    //do some calculations in there
  }
}

//set it
drawer.ScaleFunc = Drawer.OutputScaler.MyScale;
```
---
xfal has LOTS of extensions. The most detailed ones are extensions for Vector2. 
```csharp
//they are all returning values and DO NOT change the value

v.Floored();               // Math.Floor(...) on both
v.Ceiled();                // Math.Ceiling(...) on both
v.SignFloored();           // Math.Floor() without sign condition on both
v.SignCeiled();            // Math.Ceiling() without sign condition on both

v.Abs();                   // Math.Abs(...) on both
v.AbsX();                  // Math.Abs(...) on X
v.AbsY();                  // Math.Abs(...) on Y
v.IntCast();               // (int) on both
v.Rounded(digits: 0);      // Math.Round(...) on both

v.TakeX();                 // set v.Y to 0 
v.TakeY();                 // set v.X to 0

v.WhereX(123);             // set X to 123
v.WhereY(123);             // set Y ti 123
v.WhereX(x => x + 123);    // add 123 to X
v.WhereY(y => y + 123);    // add 123 to Y

v.MinSquare();             // set both on minimal value between X and Y
v.MaxSquare();             // set both on maximum value between X and Y

v.Min();                   // minimum value between X and Y
v.Max();                   // maximum value between X and Y

v.MaxAxis();               // make the smaller axis 0 (nothing changes if they are the same)
v.MinAxis();               // make the greater axis 0 (nothing changes if they are the same)

v.Normal();                // set X to -Y and Y to X
v.Perpendicular();         // set X to Y and Y to -X

v.UnitNormal();            // v.Normal() in range of 1
v.Normalized();            // vector in range of 1

v.Dot(v2)                  // dot product on both
v.Cross(v2);               // X1 * Y2 - Y1 * X2
v.DistanceTo(v2);          // distance between vectors
v.RotatedAround(v2, r);    // rotated around v2 by r radians

// supported operators: >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=

bool anyAxisLess = vec.Any() > 123;

// also supports +, -, *, /
bool bothAxesEqual = v.Both() == 123; 
```
